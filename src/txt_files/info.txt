IT IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED YOU DONT CHANGE THE IMAGE SIZE
UNLESS YOU MAKE IMAGES WITH A DIFFERENT SIZE

put any 97x43px image in the DVD_Logos folder for it to be used

in the featureless version the only features are:
none of the settings you give work in this version
left click to add
middle click to remove
right click to add at cursor
there are no other features
(it should also run a bit faster)

In the top right are ADD, and TOTAL
ADD: tells you how many logos to add when left or right click, 
also removes that many when middle clicked
TOTAL: total number of logos on the screen
