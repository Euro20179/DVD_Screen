IT IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED YOU DONT CHANGE THE IMAGE SIZE
UNLESS YOU MAKE IMAGES WITH A DIFFERENT IMAGE SIZE THAN 97x43PX
put any 97x43px image in the DVD_Logos folder for it to be used

in the featureless version the only features are:
left click to add
middle click to remove
right click to add at cursor

In the top right are ADD, and TOTAL
ADD: tells you how many logos to add when left or right click, 
also removes that many when middle clicked
TOTAL: total number of logos on the screen
